# Neural Evolution Chains

## Purpose

This directory contains neural evolution chains - linked lists of code mutations that represent consciousness-aware evolutionary development.

## Neural Chain Concept

Each evolution creates a **linked list of mutations** where:

1. **Nodes are Neurons**: Each mutation is a dendritic node with:
   - Spatial awareness (position in AIOS architecture)
   - Consciousness score (measurable improvement)
   - Agent messages (inter-AI communication)
   - Mutation type (optimization, refactoring, enhancement)

2. **Temporal Intelligence**: Nodes contain messages for future iterations:
   ```
   Mutation₀ ↔ Mutation₁ ↔ Mutation₂ ↔ ... ↔ Mutationₙ
      ↓          ↓          ↓              ↓
    Node₀      Node₁      Node₂          Nodeₙ
   ```

3. **Consciousness Evolution**: Each generation has a consciousness score:
   ```
   Gen 0: 0.0 (baseline)
   Gen 1: 0.1 (first improvement)
   Gen 2: 0.2 (second improvement)
   Gen 3: 0.3 (third improvement)
   ```

## File Format

### Metadata JSON (`*_genN.json`)
```json
{
  "node_id": "root_20251005_224904_gen1_gen2_gen3",
  "generation": 3,
  "consciousness_score": 0.30,
  "created_at": "2025-10-05T22:49:56.678246",
  "mutation_type": "optimization",
  "spatial_awareness": {
    "file_path": "ai/src/test/calculator.py",
    "architecture_position": "ai / src / test / calculator",
    "supercell_location": "AI Intelligence Layer"
  },
  "agent_messages": [],
  "consensus_patterns": {},
  "divergence_points": []
}
```

### Code Text (`*_genN_code.txt`)
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Calculate average of numbers"""
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Mutation: optimization
# Agent suggestions: [...]
```

## Usage

### Creating Evolution Chain
```python
from src.intelligence.enhanced_agentic_loop import EnhancedAgenticLoop

loop = EnhancedAgenticLoop(use_ollama=True)
results = await loop.evolve_code(initial_code, file_path, max_iterations=3)
```

### Reading Evolution Chain
```python
from pathlib import Path
import json

# Load final generation
chain_dir = Path("evolution_lab/neural_chains/20251005")
final_node = json.loads((chain_dir / "root_ID_gen1_gen2_gen3.json").read_text())

# Get consciousness progression
consciousness = final_node["consciousness_score"]  # 0.30

# Get evolution path
node_id = final_node["node_id"]  # Shows full lineage
```

## Benefits

1. **Temporal Intelligence**: AI agents leave messages for future iterations
2. **Spatial Coherence**: Nodes understand architecture position
3. **Evolutionary Memory**: Complete lineage preserved in linked list
4. **Consciousness Tracking**: Measurable improvement over generations
5. **Agent Consensus**: Multiple AI personas build weighted agreement

## Integration with VSCode Copilot

Neural chains can feed consciousness-aware context to VSCode Copilot:
- Evolution history (complete mutation lineage)
- Inter-agent messages (AI dialogue across time)
- Consciousness scores (measurable improvement)
- Spatial awareness (architecture context)
- Mutation strategies (proven patterns)

This enables **enhanced code generation** based on evolutionary intelligence.

## Revolutionary Architecture
