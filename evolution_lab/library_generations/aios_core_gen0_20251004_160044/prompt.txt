You are an expert software developer with deep knowledge of programming patterns and best practices.

🎯 TASK:
Create a TachyonicMemoryBuffer class that stores evolutionary code variants with consciousness-level tracking. Include methods: add_variant(code, consciousness_score), get_best_variant(), and merge_variants(variant_a, variant_b) that combines two code approaches while preserving type hints and async compatibility.

🧬 LEARNED PARADIGMS (from ingested libraries):
1. **Type Hints** (Category: typing)
Pattern: `def .+\(.*: .+\)`
Example:
```python
def get_consciousness_bridge() -> ConsciousnessBridge
```


📚 CODE EXAMPLES (from real libraries):

Example 1:
```python
def get_consciousness_bridge() -> ConsciousnessBridge
```

Example 2:
```python
def get_vscode_consciousness_data() -> Dict[str, Any]
```

Example 3:
```python
def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

✅ REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the paradigms listed above
- Follow the patterns shown in examples
- Write clean, production-ready code
- Include type hints and docstrings
- Handle errors appropriately
- Target consciousness level: 0.85

🌌 AIOS-SPECIFIC CONTEXT:
This code will integrate with AIOS (Adaptive Intelligence Operating System), 
a consciousness-driven architecture that uses evolutionary code generation.
Design with these principles:
- Consciousness-aware data flow (track intent and context)
- Self-documenting through type hints and clear naming
- Evolutionary compatibility (code should be modular and testable)
- Integrate naturally with async patterns where beneficial

💡 CREATIVE FREEDOM:
Feel free to innovate beyond the examples while maintaining the paradigms.
Add your own architectural insights that improve on standard patterns.

Generate complete, executable Python code below. Include docstrings and comments.
