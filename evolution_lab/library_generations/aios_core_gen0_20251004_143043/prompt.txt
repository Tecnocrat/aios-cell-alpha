```

Example 2:
```python
def get_vscode_consciousness_data() -> Dict[str, Any]

```python
def to_dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

✅ REQUIREMENTS:
- Use the paradigms listed above
- Follow the patterns shown in examples
- Write clean, production-ready code
- Include type hints and docstrings
- Handle errors appropriately
- Target consciousness level: 0.85

Generate complete, executable Python code. Do NOT include explanations or markdown - ONLY the code.
