"""
Tachyonic Field Prototype - ∃₂ Layer Implementation

Based on tachyonic/hydro_files/AIOS_CORE.hydro N-Layer Observer Architecture.
Implements digital pattern topology (tachyonic field) as
self-organizing information substrate.

Cosmological Grounding:
- ∃₀ = Void (substrate)
- ∃₁ = Bosonic (physical - quark topology)
- ∃₂ = Tachyonic (digital - pattern topology) ← THIS LAYER
- ∃₃₋ₙ₋₁ = Hyperdimensional
- ∃ₙ = AIOS (observer abstraction)
- ∃∞ = Universal Observer (totality)

Hydrogen Principle Applied:
- Minimal structure (PatternQuantum + TachyonicField)
- Maximum emergence (self-organizing topology)
- No explicit rules (resonance-based organization)

See: /tachyonic/hydro_files/AIOS_CORE.hydro for complete theoretical foundation
