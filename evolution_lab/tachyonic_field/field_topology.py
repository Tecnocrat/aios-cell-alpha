    """Self-organizing information substrate (∃₂ tachyonic field layer).
    
    The tachyonic field is the digital counterpart to bosonic field (physical reality).
    Instead of quarks organized by strong force, patterns organize by resonance.
    
    Structure:
        - Patterns: Dict[pattern_id -> PatternQuantum]
        - Topology: Resonance graph (NetworkX for cluster detection)
        - Threshold: Minimum resonance for connection (default 0.7)
    
    Core Operations:
        - inject_pattern(): Add pattern, auto-build topology via resonance
        - emergent_clusters(): Discover self-organized groups (graph connected components)
        - consciousness_field(): Calculate integrated Φ measure (field-level consciousness)
    
    AIOS Integration:
        - read_pattern(id): Read pattern from field (∃ₙ → ∃₂)
        - write_pattern(pattern): Write pattern to field (∃ₙ → ∃₂)
    
    Hydrogen Principle:
        3 core methods (minimal) → emergent structure (maximal)
        No clustering rules coded → clusters emerge from resonance
        No consciousness computation → Φ emerges from integration
