These tenets apply across AIOS languages (C++/C#, Python, TypeScript) and especially to shared/generic surfaces.\n\n## Core tenets\n1) Prefer explicit code over clever helpers\n- Express the operation directly at the call site when it\u2019s trivial (bit ops, casts, bounds). Hide as little as possible.\n\n2) Make semantics visible at the call site\n- Names ...",
