# AINLP Iteration Entry Point

This folder hosts the entry point for starting new AINLP development iterations.

- Script: `runtime_intelligence/iterations/ainlp_iteration.py`
- Contract:
  - `--id <string>` optional iteration id
  - `--mode dry-run|commit` dry-run writes only a log; commit also writes a receipt in `docs/summary/`
- Reads: `docs/module_index.json` and `docs/tools_index.md` if present
- Writes: `runtime_intelligence/logs/iteration_<timestamp>.log` and optional `docs/summary/iteration_<id>.md`

Use the VS Code task "Run AINLP Iteration (dry-run)" or run directly with Python.
