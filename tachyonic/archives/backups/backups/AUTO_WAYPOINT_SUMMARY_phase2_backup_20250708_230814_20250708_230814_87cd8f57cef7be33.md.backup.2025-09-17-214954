### **Smart Context Preservation Features**

**Adaptive Algorithm**:
```javascript
baseIterations = randomBetween(6, 9)  // Natural variation
healthScore = assessSystemHealth()     // 0.0 - 1.0 scale

if (healthScore < 0.7 || userConfused) {
    executeEmergencyBootstrap()
} else if (iterations >= baseIterations) {
    executeScheduledReingestion()
}
```

**Health Scoring Matrix**:
- 📚 **Documentation Health** (25%): Completeness, consistency, currency
- 🔧 **Build System Health** (25%): Dependencies, compilation, environment
- 💻 **Code Integrity** (25%): Module structure, file presence, syntax
- 🔗 **Integration Health** (25%): Cross-language communication, tests

## 🎯 **Answers to Your Specific Concerns**

### **1. License Strategy** ✅ RESOLVED
- **Analysis**: Comprehensive framework for license decision
- **Recommendation**: MIT for development phase, dual licensing for commercial
- **Implementation**: `LICENSE_DECISION.md` with detailed comparison
- **Status**: Ready for your final decision

### **2. Reingestion Frequency** ✅ OPTIMIZED
- **Old**: Fixed every 3 iterations (too aggressive)
- **New**: Adaptive 6-9 iterations + health-based triggers
- **Smart Triggers**: User confusion, system errors, test failures
- **Result**: Natural flow with proactive protection

### **3. Dual README Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Confusing dual README.md files
- **Solution**: Renamed `docs/README.md` → `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
- **Result**: Clear hierarchy and navigation
- **Updated**: All references and links corrected

## 🚀 **Next Phase Ready**

### **Immediate Capabilities**
✅ **Any AI can bootstrap instantly** using `AI_context_reallocator.md`
