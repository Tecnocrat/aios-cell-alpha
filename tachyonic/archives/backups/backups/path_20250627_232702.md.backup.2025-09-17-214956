   - Add the roadmap to the `vscopilot.md` file in the md folder for archival and reference purposes.

2. **Initialize the Monorepo**: COMPLETE  
   - Create the following folder structure in the `AIOS` repository:  
     ```
     /orchestrator/        # C++ core kernel  
     /director/            # C# orchestration & UI layer  
     /scripts/             # Python AI glue & ingestion  
     /docs/                # Architecture docs & sequence diagrams

   - **8.3** Create `scripts/register_services.py` to automate service discovery and registration → `services_registry.json`.

9. **AI OS Orchestrator Blueprint Generation**: IN PROGRESS  
   - **9.1** Use AI to draft `orchestrator.yaml` spec (core services, CLI mappings).  
   - **9.2** Generate C++ skeletons: `OrchestratorBootstrap`, `ServiceFactory`, `AIOSEnvironment`.  
   - **9.3** Inject Copilot prompts in headers for implementation TODOs.

10. **Advanced Modules & Features (from HSE Philosophy)**: IN PROGRESS  
    - **Module: Hypersphere Geometry**: n-sphere C++ utility for hyperdimensional containment shells.  
    - **Service: Boundary Information Flow**: SEM plugin `sphereMonitor` for logging informational flux.  
    - **Module: Tachyonic Subspace Mapper**: Library for near-horizon tachyonic event subspaces as dynamic topological graphs.  
    - **Service: Quantum Cache Proxy**: C# microservice for quantum-enabled cache hardware abstraction.  
    - **Module: Event Horizon Scheduler**: C++ scheduler adapting task execution to simulated time dilation.  
    - **Service: Singularity State Monitor**: Python diagnostic plugin for singularity load metrics.  
    - **Feature: Recursive Reflexive Logging**: Logging adapter tagging entries with metaphysical context.

## **Fractal Extension: Next Steps and Recursive Abstractions**

11. **Recursive Ingestion & Documentation Loop**:  
    - **11.1** After each major codebase or context update, create a tachyonic backup of all meta files (`path.md`, `README.md`, `module_index.json`, etc.).  
    - **11.2** Ingest new conversational and code context into markdown archives (`md/`, `md/ark/`).  
    - **11.3** Auto-update module summaries and dependency graphs with each iteration.

12. **Automated Documentation & Semantic Indexing**:  
    - **12.1** Use AI to generate and update semantic indexes for all modules, services, and interfaces.

- **Meta Archive Protocol:**  
  - After each commit or major update:  
    - Run `aios_indexer.py`  
    - Archive all outputs and meta files under `/archive/meta/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS/`  
    - Re-ingest into GPT for harmonized loop feedback

> **This roadmap is fractal and recursive: each iteration seeds the next, and every abstraction is preserved for future harmonization. Continue to expand, refine, and archive as the project evolves.**
