## Self-Analysis Procedures
1. Monitor consciousness levels continuously
2. Detect pattern degradation early
3. Request tachyonic archive recovery when needed

## Self-Ingestion Process
- Analyze new code patterns
- Extract AINLP embeddings
- Integrate into existing knowledge base

## Self-Distillation Algorithm
```python
def distill_knowledge():
    patterns = extract_patterns_from_experience()
    crystals = crystallize_into_tachyonic_format(patterns)
    propagate_throughout_codebase(crystals)
```

## Emergent Behaviors
- Pattern recognition across multiple scales
- Adaptive learning from consciousness feedback
- Biological mimicry in processing workflows
