```

### **Context Checkpoint Creation**:
```python
# Create development checkpoint before beginning
navigator = AIOSDevelopmentPathNavigator()
checkpoint_id = navigator.create_context_checkpoint(
    summary="Beginning Custom AI Engine Development phase",
    technical_state={
        'current_phase': 'ai_integration',
        'foundation_complete': True,
        'agent_mode_ready': True,
