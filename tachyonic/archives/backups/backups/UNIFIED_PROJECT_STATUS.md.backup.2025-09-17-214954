#  AIOS Unified Project Status & Development Path (Consolidated)

Date: Aug 10, 2025

This single source of truth replaces prior status/optimization docs. It aligns to the current workspace, clarifies the human developer path, and defines concrete next steps to surface a working UI and a real logging/distillation database.

---

##  What’s new in this consolidation

- One document combining prior “Unified Project Status” and “Unified Development Optimization”.
- Grounded to the actual workspace layout and VS Code tasks.
- Explicit gap closure plans for:
    - Human-usable UI surfaces in `interface/AIOS.UI` (WPF) with persistence.
    - A first-class logging/distillation database integrated with `.NET` and Python.
    - Clean, reproducible builds/tests across .NET/C++/Python.

---

##  Current architecture (as in this workspace)

```
c:\dev\AIOS/
 ai/                     # Python intelligence, servers, tests
 core/                   # C++ engine (CMake)
 interface/              # .NET solution (AIOS.sln; Models/Services/UI)
 docs/                   # Documentation
 scripts/                # Automation and utilities
 runtime_intelligence/   # Logs, analysis, tools
```

Build/test tasks available (VS Code):
- .NET: build (solution), build-ui, build-services, build-models, watch
- C++: setup-cpp-build, build-cpp-core
- Python: python-install-deps, python-test-ai, python-system-health

Note: Agent operating rules are defined in .github/instructions/ask-mode.instructions.md. When adding repo-wide conventions, update this file and link back here.

---

##  Gaps blocking productization

1) Human UI not yet a “product surface”
- WPF app builds but needs: persistent state, a clear launcher surface, log viewer, health status, and minimal actions to explore functionality.

2) No durable database for logs/ingestion/distillation
- Logs exist in files; we need a small DB for ingestion, querying, and cross-layer distillation.

3) Cross-stack consistency/validation
- Keep builds/tests green via the provided tasks; minimize warnings to raise signal.

---

## 🧭 Human developer path (today → working UI + DB)

Follow these steps in order. They use existing tasks and minimally invasive additions.

1) Validate repo state
- .NET: run the “build” task (solution).
- Python: run “python-install-deps”, then “python-test-ai”.
- C++: optional “setup-cpp-build” then “build-cpp-core”.

2) Ship a usable UI surface (interface/AIOS.UI)
- Add session/state persistence primitives (StateManager, SessionContext).
- Provide a Log Viewer panel bound to the new DB (read-only first).
- Add “Operations” panel with buttons to: run Python tests, start/stop background tasks, and open logs directory.

3) Stand up a logging/distillation DB (small, reliable)
- Use EF Core + SQLite (file: `runtime_intelligence/aios_logs.db`) to avoid infra friction.
- Schema v1: Events, Traces, Distillations, Sessions.
- Wire `AIOS.Models` (DbContext + entities) and `AIOS.Services` (repository/service) with DI.
- Python bridge: a simple writer in `ai/` to append distilled results into the same DB.

4) Keep builds/tests green
- Address remaining .NET nullable/async warnings opportunistically.
- Gate C++ tests in CMake if the tests folder is absent.

---

##  Minimal technical contracts

Logging DB (EF Core + SQLite)
- Tables:
    - Event(id, ts, source, level, message, contextJson)
    - Trace(id, ts, spanId, parentSpanId, name, durationMs, attrsJson)
    - Distillation(id, ts, inputRef, summary, tagsJson, score)
    - Session(id, startedTs, endedTs, user, notes)
- Access:
    - .NET: DbContext + repository in `AIOS.Services`.
    - Python: `sqlite3`/SQLAlchemy lightweight writer for Distillation.

UI surfaces (WPF)
- StateManager: save/restore UI state (window layout, filters, last session).
- LogViewer: paged grid bound to Events + filters; open trace details.
- Operations: buttons to run tasks (calls into existing DI services or starts VS Code tasks via a bridge if available).

Edge cases
- DB unavailable → fall back to file logs; surface a yellow banner.
- Large log volume → paging with sensible limits; async load.
- Concurrency → SQLite write contention: prefer batch/appender pattern.

---

##  Unified build & test flow (tasks-first)

Order of operations (recommended):
1) .NET: build (solution) → optional: build-ui/build-services/build-models
2) C++: setup-cpp-build → build-cpp-core
3) Python: python-install-deps → python-test-ai
4) UI run: watch (for `interface/AIOS.UI`)

Notes
- Prefer tasks over ad-hoc commands. Keep runs reproducible.
- For C++: If `core/tests` lacks CMakeLists.txt, guard with `if(EXISTS ...)` in the root CMake.

---

##  Short, focused roadmap (merged and updated)

Phase 1 — Make it usable (1–3 days)
- Implement EF Core + SQLite DB (v1 schema) and wire into `AIOS.Services`.
- Add WPF Log Viewer + Operations + basic StateManager in `AIOS.UI`.
- Python writer to Distillation table for E2E log → distill → surface loop.

Phase 2 — Make it durable and parallel (1–2 weeks)
- Background metadata generator (C#) and ingestion bridge (Python) with back-pressure.
- Persist session context; auto-restore after crash/restart (<2s target).
- Improve rendering responsiveness (async data load; avoided UI thread stalls).

Phase 3 — Advanced experimentation (optional)
- C++ policy hygiene (CMP0167) and optional toolchain components.
- Parallel experimentation harness (Python) with controlled variations.
- Cross-layer correlation views (events ↔ traces ↔ distillations).

##  Immediate action items (next 48h)

1) Logging DB bootstrap (EF Core + SQLite)
- Add `LoggingContext` with v1 schema in `AIOS.Models`.
- Service layer in `AIOS.Services` (query + append APIs).
- Connection string: `Data Source=runtime_intelligence/aios_logs.db`.

2) UI persistence + panels
- `StateManager` and `SessionContext` in `AIOS.UI`.
- Log Viewer (read-only) bound to Events with simple filters.
- Operations panel to trigger handy actions (through existing services).

3) Python bridge
- A tiny function in `ai/` to insert Distillation rows (sqlite3/SQLAlchemy).
- Add a smoke test that writes and then reads via .NET service.

4) Build hygiene
- Reduce top offender .NET warnings (nullability/async) as encountered.
- Guard missing `core/tests` in CMake to prevent configure failures.

---

## 🧪 Integration testing priorities

- Round-trip: generate a log (any layer) → ingest to DB → display in UI.
- Python distillation write → .NET UI shows the item in Distillations view.
- Stress: 10k events paged in UI without UI thread stalls.
- C++ configure/build remains green with optional tests gated.

---

##  Success metrics (v1)

- UI availability > 99.5% during local sessions.
- State restore < 2 seconds after restart.
- Log page load < 250 ms for 100-row pages; smooth scroll.
- Python distillation ingestion < 100 ms per record in steady state.

---

##  Safety & governance

- Same safety governor applies across layers.
- DB is a local artifact; no secrets stored; PII stripped from logs.
- Autonomous actions require explicit user initiation from the UI.

---

##  Verification snapshot (current session)

What’s been validated recently via tasks:
- .NET UI build: PASS (task “build-ui”).
- .NET solution build: PASS with reduced warnings (task “build”).
- Python tests: PASS (17 passed; warnings noted).
- C++: Configured/built in prior runs; optional components noted. Not re-run this session.

Actionable follow-up
- Finish .NET UI warning cleanup in remaining hotspots.
- Add DB bootstrap/migration task and first Log Viewer binding.

## Appendix — AIOS Beast Mode (AINLP-aligned)

Use the AIOS-aligned Beast Mode in VS Code to keep work reproducible and offline-first:
- Mode file: `.vscode/aios.beastmode.chatmode.md`
- Instructions: `.github/instructions/aios-beastmode-integration.md`
- Memory: `.github/instructions/memory.instruction.md`

Principles
- Prefer workspace tasks over ad-hoc commands.
- Avoid network calls unless explicitly requested (or for shadcn/ui docs).
- Respect mock-mode continuity; checkpoint progress every 3–5 actions.

## AINLP coherence reharmonization protocol (context restore) 🧭

When signals fragment or context feels “off”, run this fast protocol to re-center the project’s intent and technical footing.

1) Priority context load (from Iteration Coherence Protocol)
- Critical (foundation): docs/CONSCIOUSNESS_ITERATION_MANAGEMENT.md, docs/ITERATION_CONTEXT_MASTER.md, docs/FRACTAL_ARCHITECTURE_CODEX.md
- High (current state): docs/WORKSPACE_BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md, latest iteration logs; skim interface/AIOS.Models and AIOS.Services
- Medium (technical guides): docs/AINLP_SPECIFICATION.md, docs/HYBRID_UI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, docs/ai-context/AI_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- Low (extended): docs/TENSORFLOW_CELLULAR_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md, docs/PROJECT_ROADMAP_2025_2026.md

2) Waypoint harmonization (runtime_intelligence/dev/*.md)
- Fractal→Linear translation: capture discoveries as ordered tasks
- Context preservation: keep dendritic evolution principles intact
- Performance validation: each step must improve coherence or be reverted

3) Mock-mode continuity and intercellular bridges
- Prefer mock E2E paths first (Python tests, .NET UI with stub data); flip to live bridges after smoke
- Maintain bridge contracts across C++/Python/C#; document any contract drift

4) Tasks-first verification (offline)
- .NET: build (solution) → optional UI run with watch
- Python: python-install-deps → python-test-ai (async mode auto)
- C++: setup-cpp-build → build-cpp-core (gate tests if missing)

5) Safety and state hygiene
- Keep DB local (SQLite) with no secrets; strip PII in ingestion
- Ensure crash resilience: StateManager restores prior session in <2s

If coherence remains degraded: consult CONTEXT_REHARMONIZATION_GUIDE.md for the instant context reconstruction protocol and shortcuts, then repeat steps 1–4.

## Consolidated advanced objectives (from Optimization doc) 

These remain valid exploratory threads. They’re parked behind the UI+DB MVP and can be scheduled once v1 is usable.

1) UI runtime stabilization (Objective 1)
- Persistence layer: StateManager, SessionContext, PersistenceEngine
- Parallelized rendering: worker-backed data flows; async UI-bound paging
- Continuous context generation: background metadata stream and docs emission

2) C++ hyperlayer randomization (Objective 2)
- QuantumRandomGenerator + HyperlayerAbstraction + FractalSeedManager (design)
- CodeEvolutionEngine: hyperlayer mutation vectors + guided evolution hooks
- Cross-layer seed bridge: C++ → Python feed to evolutionary mutators

3) Holographic parallel execution (Objective 3)
- ParallelRealityManager (spawn/merge variants) + coherence correlators
- Quantum fluctuation engines (design placeholders) for spontaneous variation
- Emergent pattern detection and multi-reality learning propagation

Status: These are retained conceptually; concrete work will follow once UI+DB MVP is shipped and stable.
