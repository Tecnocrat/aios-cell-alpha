## 🎯 **AIOS-Specific Considerations**

### **Project Characteristics**
- **Revolutionary AI OS**: High commercial potential
- **Multi-language Architecture**: Complex IP considerations
- **Community-Driven**: Benefits from open collaboration
- **Early Stage**: Needs adoption and feedback

### **Strategic Factors**

**For Open Source (MIT/Apache 2.0):**
- Encourages rapid adoption and testing
- Attracts developers and contributors
- Builds ecosystem and community
- Establishes AIOS as industry standard

**For Copyleft (GPL v3):**
- Protects against proprietary capture
- Ensures improvements benefit community
- Maintains open source ecosystem
- Prevents commercial exploitation without contribution

**For Proprietary:**
- Maximizes commercial control
- Enables clear monetization strategy
- Protects unique innovations
- Allows selective licensing

## 🚀 **Recommendation Framework**

### **Phase-Based Approach**
```
Phase 1 (Current): Research/Development
└── MIT or Apache 2.0 for maximum feedback

Phase 2: Community Building
└── Continue open source for adoption

Phase 3: Commercial Strategy
└── Evaluate dual licensing or commercial terms
```

### **Dual Licensing Strategy**
Consider offering multiple licensing options:
- **Open Source License**: For community and non-commercial use
- **Commercial License**: For commercial applications
- **Enterprise License**: For large-scale deployments
