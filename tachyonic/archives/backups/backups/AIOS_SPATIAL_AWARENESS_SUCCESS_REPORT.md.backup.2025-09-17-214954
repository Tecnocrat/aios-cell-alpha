## 🎮 **Usage Instructions**

### **For AI Engines (Mandatory Reading Protocol)**
Before ANY file/folder operation, AI engines MUST:

1. **Read spatial metadata**: Check for `.aios_spatial_metadata.json` in target folder
2. **Validate operation**: Ensure compliance with architectural classification
3. **Follow AI guidance**: Use recommendations from metadata for informed decisions
4. **Reference enforcement**: See `ai/CHAT_MODE_SPATIAL_AWARENESS.md` for full protocol

### **Quick Commands**
```powershell
# Check spatial awareness for folder
python ai/tools/aios_holographic_metadata_system.py --read-metadata "path/to/folder"

# Update entire holographic system
python ai/tools/aios_holographic_metadata_system.py --create-system --overwrite

# Test cross-dialogue intelligence
python ai/membrane/aios_cross_dialogue_intelligence.py

# Run spatial awareness demo
python demo_spatial_awareness_test.py
```

## **Problem Solved: Spatial Awareness Crisis**

### **Root Cause Identified**
AI engines were creating files/folders without understanding existing workspace structure, leading to:
- Attempts to create folders that already existed
- Inappropriate file placement in system directories
- Lack of architectural awareness causing chaos
- No context about folder purposes and consciousness levels

### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Distributed Intelligence**: Every important folder now contains spatial metadata
2. **Architectural Classification**: Folders categorized by consciousness level and purpose
3. **AI Guidance Integration**: Metadata provides specific guidance for AI operations
4. **System Protection**: Comprehensive filtering prevents access to .git, build, env folders
5. **Enforcement Protocol**: Mandatory reading requirements for AI engines
