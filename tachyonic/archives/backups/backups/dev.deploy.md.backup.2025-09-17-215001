# AIOS Deployment Strategy - Runtime Intelligence Operations

##  Tachyonic anchor/reset & coherence gates (distilled)
- Anchor: `dev.run.md` is the deployment anchor of record for step-by-step approvals.
- Reset: `.aios_context.json` snapshots live in `runtime_intelligence/logs/aios_context/` with sequence naming.
- Stability: pin Python to aios_env; avoid noisy auto-restore; keep `AIOS.code-workspace` authoritative.
- Guardrails: no root-level new files; prefer module-appropriate folders; always add a tachyonic changelog entry for path/behavior changes.
- Coherence gates: run LFC/GPC quick score; for API/path changes, scan usages + update tests/docs before rolling deploy. See `docs/tachyonic/AIOS.Harmonizer.AINL.md`.

2. **Adaptive Operations**: Context-driven deployment optimization with self-learning
3. **Zero-Downtime Intelligence**: Continuous operation through intelligent deployment patterns

**Deployment Readiness Metrics (Post-Refactorization):**
- System Health: 100% operational (8/8 integration tests passing)
- Error Status: 0 critical deployment blockers (from 88+ pre-refactorization)
- Performance: Sub-millisecond cached operations (0.0ms validated)
- Type Safety: 100% Pylance compliance ensuring deployment stability
