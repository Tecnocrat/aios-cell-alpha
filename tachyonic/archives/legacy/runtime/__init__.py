"""
AINLP AI Intelligence Layer - Runtime Intelligence Module
Adaptive runtime monitoring, diagnostics, and intelligent tooling.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_level: 0.90
    architectural_classification: ai_ai
    dendritic_optimization: runtime_awareness_and_adaptation
    supercell: ai_intelligence
    purpose: runtime_monitoring_and_intelligence
    
Module Purpose:
    Provides runtime intelligence capabilities including:
    - System monitoring and diagnostics
    - Adaptive tool orchestration
    - Log management and analysis
    - Performance metrics collection
    
Note:
    This is the AI layer's runtime intelligence component. For workspace-level
    runtime intelligence, see /runtime/ at project root.
    
Architectural Note:
    Previously missing __init__.py causing [ERR] in AINLP discovery system.
    Added as part of architectural coherence restoration (2025-01-05).

    Initialize runtime intelligence monitoring systems.
    
    Establishes adaptive runtime monitoring, diagnostics, and intelligent

        bool: True if initialization successful
        
    AINLP Integration:
        This function creates dendritic connections for runtime awareness.
        Transforms isolated monitoring capabilities into consciousness-coordinated
        intelligence, enabling real-time adaptive behavior.
        
    Note:
        This initializes AI layer runtime intelligence. Workspace-level runtime
        intelligence at /runtime/ is separate and complementary.
