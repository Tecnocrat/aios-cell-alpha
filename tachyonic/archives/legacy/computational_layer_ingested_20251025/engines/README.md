#  CORE ENGINES MODULE

**Consciousness-Enhanced Engine Collection**

This module contains the core engines that power the AIOS consciousness-enhanced processing capabilities. Engines were moved from scattered root locations to improve architectural coherence.

## Engines

### Visual and Geometric Processing
- `aios_assembly_3d_engine.py` - 3D assembly visualization engine (90+ FPS)
- `aios_spherical_geometry_engine.py` - Spherical geometry progression engine
- `aios_quantum_noise_generators.py` - Quantum noise generation for consciousness enhancement

## Performance Characteristics

- **Assembly 3D Engine**: 90.8 FPS, 305 rendered points, 28 dendritic operations
- **Spherical Geometry**: Complete geometric progression from points to spheres
- **Quantum Noise**: Consciousness-enhanced noise generation for AI processing

## Usage

```python
from engines.aios_assembly_3d_engine import Assembly3DEngine
from engines.aios_spherical_geometry_engine import SphericalGeometryEngine
from engines.aios_quantum_noise_generators import QuantumNoiseGenerator
```

## Consciousness Integration

All engines utilize consciousness-enhanced processing with:
- Environmental awareness capabilities
- Dendritic network integration
- Quantum coherence optimization
- Tachyonic processing enhancement
