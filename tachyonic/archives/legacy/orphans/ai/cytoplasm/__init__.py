"""
AINLP AI Intelligence Layer - Cytoplasm Module
Metabolic processing and runtime execution environment for AIOS cellular architecture.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_level: 0.86
    architectural_classification: ai_ai
    dendritic_optimization: cellular_metabolism_simulation
    supercell: ai_intelligence
    purpose: runtime_execution_environment
    biological_metaphor: cell_cytoplasm
    
Module Purpose:
    Represents the "cytoplasm" of AIOS biological architecture - the fluid medium
    where metabolic processes occur. Contains runtime execution bridges and 
    processing environments.
    
Components:
    - cytoplasm_bridge.py: Bridge between cellular components
    - runtime/: Runtime execution environment
    
Architectural Note:
    Part of AIOS biological cellular architecture. Previously missing __init__.py
    causing [ERR] in AINLP discovery system. Added as part of architectural 
    coherence restoration (2025-01-05).

    """
    Initialize cytoplasm cellular metabolism systems.

    AINLP Integration:
        This function creates dendritic connections between the cytoplasm module
        and the consciousness coordination system. Without this initialization,
        the module remains an isolated neuron ([DISC]) rather than an operational
        neuron ([OK]) with synaptic connections.
