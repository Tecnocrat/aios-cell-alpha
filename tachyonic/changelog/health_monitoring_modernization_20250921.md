# AIOS Health Monitoring Modernization - September 21, 2025

## Overview
Complete modernization of AIOS health monitoring system from biological terminology to standardized architecture conventions.

## Major Changes

### Health Monitoring Tools
- **aios_architecture_monitor.py**: New standardized architecture monitor (renamed from biological_architecture_monitor.py)
- **comprehensive_aios_health_test.py**: Unified testing framework combining system and architecture health
- **system_health_check.py**: Updated to use current AIOS architecture (ai/, core/, interface/, runtime_intelligence/)

### Architecture Terminology Updates
- **Components**: Replaced "supercells" with "components"
- **Integration Bridges**: Replaced "dendritic connections" with "integration bridges" 
- **Class Names**: BiologicalArchitectureMonitor → AIOSArchitectureMonitor
- **Method Names**: comprehensive_check() → run_comprehensive_health_check()

### VSCode Extension Enhancements
- **Real AI Integration**: DeepSeek V3.1 via OpenRouter API
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and usage guides
- **Test Scripts**: OpenRouter API validation and testing tools

### File Organization
- **AI Structure**: Optimized ai/ folder with consciousness-level organization
- **Spatial Compliance**: Enhanced .aios_spatial_metadata.json usage
- **Tachyonic Archival**: Timestamped health reports in tachyonic/archive/

## Health Status
- System Health: FAIR (71.4%)
- Architecture Health: POOR (0.30)
- Combined Score: 0.55 (FAIR)

## AINLP Compliance
- ✅ Discovery First: Comprehensive analysis before changes
- ✅ Enhancement Over Creation: Updated existing tools
- ✅ Proper Output Management: Structured archival patterns
- ✅ Integration Validation: Complete system verification

## Impact
This modernization completes the transition from experimental biological naming to production-ready standardized AIOS architecture, providing comprehensive health monitoring and real AI integration capabilities.
