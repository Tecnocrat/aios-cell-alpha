# Requirements File Compliance Report

**Generated**: 2025-01-21 15:47:00 UTC  
**Scope**: Python dependency compliance validation  
**Status**: All dependencies properly managed

## Dependency Analysis

### psutil Package Status
The `psutil` package required for sophisticated process management is already properly included in the AIOS requirements files:

#### Primary Requirements (c:\dev\AIOS\requirements.txt)
```
psutil>=5.9.0,<6.0
```
- **Status**: ✅ Included in canonical requirements
- **Version Constraint**: Properly bounded for stability
- **Usage**: System and process monitoring for Interface Bridge

#### Infrastructure Requirements (c:\dev\AIOS\ai\infrastructure\requirements.txt)  
```
psutil>=5.9.0
```
- **Status**: ✅ Included in AI infrastructure stack
- **Version Constraint**: Minimum version specified
- **Context**: Required for server management and health monitoring

### All Server Management Dependencies Satisfied

#### HTTP Server Stack
```
fastapi>=0.100.0,<0.110     # API framework
uvicorn>=0.22.0,<0.30       # ASGI server
httpx>=0.24.0,<0.26         # HTTP client for health checks
requests>=2.31.0,<3.0       # HTTP requests for API testing
```

#### Process Management Stack  
```
psutil>=5.9.0,<6.0          # Process lifecycle management
watchdog>=3.0.0,<4.0        # File system monitoring (if needed)
```

#### Data and Serialization
```
pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0        # Data validation and serialization
click>=8.1.0,<9.0           # CLI interface support
```

## Compliance Verification

### Installation Test Results
```bash
# Confirmed during server manager implementation
pip install psutil>=5.9.0  # SUCCESS - Package available and installed
```

### Requirements File Consistency
- ✅ **Primary Requirements**: psutil properly included with version bounds
- ✅ **Infrastructure Requirements**: psutil included with minimum version
- ✅ **Version Compatibility**: No conflicts between requirement files
- ✅ **Dependency Resolution**: All transitive dependencies satisfied

### Usage Validation
```python
# Confirmed working in server_manager.py
import psutil
pid = psutil.Process(server_pid)  # Process management
```

## Conclusion

All Python dependencies for the sophisticated server management implementation are properly managed and included in existing requirements files. No additional requirements file updates are needed.

### Status Summary
- **psutil**: ✅ Already included in both requirements files
- **HTTP Stack**: ✅ FastAPI, uvicorn, httpx, requests all included  
- **Process Management**: ✅ All dependencies satisfied
- **Installation Testing**: ✅ Verified working in implementation
- **Version Compatibility**: ✅ No conflicts detected

The AIOS project maintains excellent dependency management with all server management requirements properly specified and versioned.
