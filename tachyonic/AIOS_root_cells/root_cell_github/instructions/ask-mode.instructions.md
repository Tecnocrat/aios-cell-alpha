# AIOS Ask Mode (minimal)

This repository favors standard agent behavior with low noise. For guidance, refer to:
- docs/AIOS/AGENT_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md (condensed operating contract)
- docs/AIOS/ENGINEERING_TENETS_KERNEL_GRADE.md (engineering tenets)

Operational hints:
- Prefer existing tasks/scripts over ad‑hoc commands.
- Keep edits small and validated (build/test) with brief summaries.
- Show a short checklist of the user’s requirements and mark progress.

These hints are advisory and lightweight to avoid over-constraining default agentic behavior.
