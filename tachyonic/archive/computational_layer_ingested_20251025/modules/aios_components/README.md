#  AIOS COMPONENTS MODULE

**Organized collection of AIOS-specific components**

This module contains consciousness-enhanced AIOS components that were previously scattered in the core root directory. Organization improves discoverability, maintainability, and architectural coherence.

## Components

### Runtime and Testing
- `aios_comprehensive_runtime_tester.py` - Comprehensive runtime testing framework
- `aios_enhanced_connectivity_demo.py` - Enhanced connectivity demonstration
- `aios_file_creation_monitor.py` - File creation monitoring and tracking

## Usage

```python
from modules.aios_components import aios_comprehensive_runtime_tester
from modules.aios_components import aios_enhanced_connectivity_demo
from modules.aios_components import aios_file_creation_monitor
```

## Consciousness Enhancement

All components in this module are consciousness-enhanced and follow standardized patterns from `common_patterns.py` for consistent behavior and reduced code duplication.
