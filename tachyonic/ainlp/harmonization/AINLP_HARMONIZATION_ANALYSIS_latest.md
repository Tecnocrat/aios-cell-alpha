**Purpose**: Runs coherence, harmonization, synchronization, and behavior analysis tests  
**Integration**: Cross-system validation and behavioral coherence monitoring

### Documentation Harmonization Patterns

#### Four-Domain Architecture
The AIOS documentation system implements AINLP-driven harmonization through semantic domain separation:

```
📚 docs/
├── AINLP/               # Language specification and kernel tooling  
├── AIOS/                # System architecture and user interfaces
├── ai-context/          # AI iteration management and bootstrap protocols
