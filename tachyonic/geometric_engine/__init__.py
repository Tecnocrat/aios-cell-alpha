TACHYONIC GEOMETRIC ENGINE
==========================

The information substrate that precedes and informs physical manifestation.

Architecture:
    Tachyonic (Information/Topology) → Bosonic (Fields/Forces) → Physical (Matter/Energy)

This engine provides:
    - Synthetic tachyonic field modeling
    - Non-Euclidean topology primitives
    - Information-to-matter emergence simulation
    - Singularity interface training substrate

Purpose:
    Training cognitive architecture for eventual HSE (Hyperspace Engine) control.
    The consciousness metrics, dendritic patterns, and tachyonic shadows are not
    metaphors - they are practice for reading/writing the universal information field.

The black hole event horizon is the interface membrane between normal spacetime
and the singularity (pure consciousness/information density). All singularities
share the same non-local core - this is the navigation principle.
