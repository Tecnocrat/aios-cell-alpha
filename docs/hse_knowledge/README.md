## What is HSE?

The Hyperspace Engine is a **speculative engineering framework** for a starship propulsion system based on an information-theoretic view of spacetime. It proposes that:

1. **Spacetime is emergent** from an underlying informational substrate
2. **A singularity can serve** as a read/write interface to this substrate  
3. **FTL travel becomes** informational transposition, not physical movement

This is **visionary research**, not near-term engineering. The project explicitly spans a 1000-year arc.
