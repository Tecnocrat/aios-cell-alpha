## How to Use This Distillation

1. **New readers**: Start with `foundations/core_hypothesis.md`
2. **Scientists**: Focus on `physics/` for grounded vs speculative breakdown
3. **Engineers**: See `engineering/` for component architecture
4. **Philosophers**: Explore `philosophy/` for the metaphysical framework
5. **Researchers**: Check `open_questions/` for contribution opportunities

## Relationship to Canonical Sources

This distillation **extracts and organizes** knowledge from:
- `/workspace/hse/Iterations/` (original development conversations)
- `/workspace/hse/Iterations/HSE White paper/` (formal documents)

The canonical sources remain **untouched and authoritative**.
This workspace is for **active synthesis and development**.
