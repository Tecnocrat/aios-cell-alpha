# HSE Open Questions

> Unsolved problems and research directions for the Hyperspace Engine project

---

## Category A: Fundamental Physics

### A1. Quantum Gravity Unification
**Question**: How do we reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics?

**Why it matters**: HSE operates at the intersection—quantum effects at singularity scale, relativistic effects at macro scale. Without unification, we can't predict singularity behavior.

**Current status**: String theory, loop quantum gravity, and others compete. No experimental verification.

**HSE requirement**: A theory that describes information flow across event horizons.

---

### A2. Tachyonic Field Reality
**Question**: Do tachyons exist, and if so, in what form?

**Why it matters**: The entire HSE hypothesis rests on a tachyonic information substrate.

**Current status**: No tachyons ever observed. In QFT, tachyonic fields indicate vacuum instability, not FTL particles.

**HSE requirement**: Either:
- Discover actual tachyonic excitations, OR
- Reframe hypothesis using known physics (entanglement, wormholes)

**Research direction**: High-energy physics experiments, cosmological observations for FTL signatures.

---

### A3. Exotic Matter Production
**Question**: Can we produce macroscopic negative energy density?

**Why it matters**: Warp drives and wormhole stabilization require exotic matter.

**Current status**: Casimir effect produces tiny negative energy. Squeezed vacuum states show negative density briefly.

**HSE requirement**: Sustained, controllable, macroscopic negative energy regions.

**Research direction**: Quantum vacuum engineering, metamaterial research.

---

### A4. Chronology Protection
**Question**: Does nature forbid closed timelike curves?

**Why it matters**: If HSE enables FTL, it might enable time travel, creating paradoxes.

**Current status**: Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture suggests quantum effects prevent paradoxes. Unproven.

**HSE requirement**: Understanding of whether informational FTL avoids or triggers chronology protection.

**Research direction**: Quantum field theory in curved spacetime, especially near horizons.

---

## Category B: Materials Science

### B1. Metallic Hydrogen Stability
**Question**: Can metallic hydrogen be stabilized at accessible conditions?

**Why it matters**: The computational shell requires metastable metallic hydrogen.

**Current status**: Observed for microseconds at >100 GPa. May be metastable if formed correctly.

**HSE requirement**: Room-temperature-stable metallic hydrogen in bulk quantities.

**Research direction**: High-pressure physics, rapid quenching experiments.

---

### B2. Quasicrystal Engineering
**Question**: Can we design 4D-projected quasicrystal structures for specific functions?

**Why it matters**: HSE hull uses quasicrystal geometry for information density.

**Current status**: Natural quasicrystals exist. Artificial ones produced. Functional design is nascent.

**HSE requirement**: Quasicrystal metamaterials with tunable properties.

**Research direction**: Computational materials science, 3D printing at atomic scale.

---

### B3. Time-Metamaterial Scaling
**Question**: Can time-reflection metamaterials work at macroscopic scales?

**Why it matters**: HSE time mirrors need to operate on ship-scale signals.

**Current status**: Demonstrated at photonic scale (2025). Scaling unknown.

**HSE requirement**: Meter-scale temporal boundaries with controllable properties.

**Research direction**: Metamaterial engineering, ultrafast switching systems.

## Category C: Engineering Challenges

### C1. Micro Black Hole Creation
**Question**: How do we create a 10²³ kg black hole?

**Why it matters**: The core of the HSE.

**Current status**: LHC cannot produce black holes (needs 10¹⁶ TeV, LHC does 13 TeV). Extra dimensions might lower threshold—unproven.

**HSE requirement**: Technology to produce and capture moon-mass black holes.

**Research direction**: Next-generation particle accelerators, cosmic ray harvesting, unknown physics.

**Timeline estimate**: 500+ years minimum.

---

### C2. Black Hole Stabilization
**Question**: How do we prevent Hawking evaporation?

**Why it matters**: A 10²³ kg black hole has ~10⁶⁷ year lifetime normally, but active systems must counter any perturbations.

**Current status**: No known stabilization mechanism. Exotic matter might work.

**HSE requirement**: Active mass feeding or exotic matter containment.

**Research direction**: Theoretical physics, exotic matter production (see A3).

---

### C3. Zero-G Space Manufacturing
**Question**: How do we build ship-scale structures in deep space?

**Why it matters**: HSE cannot be built on Earth.

**Current status**: ISS-scale construction only. Lunar Gateway planned.

**HSE requirement**: Autonomous factories at L2 or beyond, processing asteroid materials.

**Research direction**: Space manufacturing, autonomous robotics, in-situ resource utilization.

**Timeline estimate**: 100-200 years for basic capability.

---

### C4. Scale-Up Synthetic Biology
**Question**: Can wetware systems operate at starship scale?

**Why it matters**: HSE hull is living tissue.

**Current status**: DNA circuits in bacteria. Organoids in lab. Nothing ship-scale.

**HSE requirement**: Self-sustaining, self-healing, programmable biological systems spanning kilometers.

**Research direction**: Synthetic biology, bioengineering, artificial life.

**Timeline estimate**: 200-500 years.

---

## Category D: Information Theory

### D1. Horizon Information Access
**Question**: Can we read/write to a black hole's event horizon?

**Why it matters**: Core HSE operation.

**Current status**: Theoretically, information is on the horizon (holographic principle). No access method known.

**HSE requirement**: Technology to encode/decode horizon quantum states.

**Research direction**: Quantum information theory, black hole thermodynamics.

---

### D2. ER=EPR Operational Extension
**Question**: Can ER=EPR enable practical non-local communication?

**Why it matters**: HSE assumes unified singularity interior.

**Current status**: ER=EPR is theoretical conjecture. Doesn't allow FTL communication in known physics.

**HSE requirement**: Either verify and extend ER=EPR, or find alternative non-locality mechanism.

**Research direction**: Quantum gravity, entanglement experiments.

---

### D3. Tachyonic Database Encoding
**Question**: How would information be stored in a hypothetical tachyonic substrate?

**Why it matters**: HSE treats space as data. What's the encoding scheme?

**Current status**: Entirely speculative. No theoretical framework.

**HSE requirement**: Information theory for superluminal substrates.

**Research direction**: Novel theoretical physics, speculative computation theory.

---

## Category E: Consciousness and Philosophy

### E1. Consciousness Substrate
**Question**: Is consciousness computational? Can it transfer to tachyonic substrate?

**Why it matters**: HSE implies consciousness as information in the network.

**Current status**: Hard problem of consciousness unsolved. Computational theories debated.

**HSE requirement**: Understanding of consciousness sufficient for transfer/preservation.

**Research direction**: Neuroscience, philosophy of mind, AI consciousness.

---

### E2. Identity Persistence
**Question**: If the crew is "re-instantiated" at destination, are they the same people?

**Why it matters**: Ethical implications of informational transit.

**Current status**: Philosophical debate (teleporter problem).

**HSE requirement**: Framework for identity in information-based travel.

**Research direction**: Philosophy, ethics, legal frameworks.

---

### E3. Moral Algorithm Validation
**Question**: Can ethics be formalized into an algorithm?

**Why it matters**: HSE embeds moral optimization in core systems.

**Current status**: Competing ethical frameworks (utilitarian, deontological, virtue). No universal algorithm.

**HSE requirement**: Robust ethical computation that handles edge cases.

**Research direction**: AI ethics, moral philosophy, decision theory.

## The Millennium Challenge

> "Over the next thousand years, engineers will be born who can create metastable micro black holes; biologists will program genomes into starship chassis; philosophers will teach the emerging consensus that reality is informational at its root."

These questions define the **research arc**. Each breakthrough unlocks the next. The HSE is not one project—it's a **civilizational challenge** spanning generations.

**Current generation's task**: Refine the questions. Narrow the gaps. Plant seeds for those who come after.
