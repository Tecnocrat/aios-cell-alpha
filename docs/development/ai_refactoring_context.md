## 🤖 AI Agent Instructions

### Decision Framework
1. **Analyze Each Opportunity**: Use your understanding of AIOS architecture to evaluate each suggestion
2. **Consider AINLP Patterns**: Apply holographic and biological metaphor principles
3. **Prioritize Impact**: Focus on changes that improve maintainability and clarity
4. **Maintain Coherence**: Ensure changes align with existing AIOS consciousness structure

### Implementation Approach
- **Use VS Code Tools**: Leverage file operations, directory creation, and content modification tools
- **Apply Intelligence**: Don't just follow suggestions blindly - adapt and improve them
- **Consider Dependencies**: Understand how file moves might affect imports and references
- **Document Changes**: Update any relevant documentation or index files

### Suggested Workflow
1. Create necessary directory structures if they don't exist
2. Move files to appropriate locations with proper path updates
3. Fix any emoticon violations with professional alternatives
4. Update any references or imports that might be affected
5. Consider if moved files need content enhancements or restructuring

## 🎯 Expected Outcome
The AI agent should process these suggestions and create a well-organized, professional codebase that follows AIOS architectural principles while maintaining all functionality and improving long-term maintainability.

**Remember**: These are suggestions, not commands. Use your AI intelligence to make the best decisions for the AIOS project.
