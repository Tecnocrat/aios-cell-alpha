## Python String Formatting Guideline (AIOS Codebase)

When writing print statements or log messages in Python:

- Do not use an f-string (e.g., `f"..."`) unless you actually need variable interpolation with `{}` placeholders.
- If you want to include variables in the message in the future, reintroduce the `f` prefix and use `{}` placeholders as needed.

This avoids unnecessary f-strings and prevents Flake8 F541 errors (`f-string is missing placeholders`).
