# AIOS Biological Architecture - Complete Implementation Summary

##  Architecture Overview

The AIOS system has been successfully restructured into a complete biological architecture with proper supercell independence and dendritic supervision connections. This implementation follows the user's specification for "Build a supervisor element that leverages the toolset of Core Engine. The components (organs) of the AI Intelligence supercell are monitored by this supervisor that is called by the cytoplasm. This supervisor is a connecting dendritic layer that orders the AI Intelligence requests and processes them IN/OUT for the Core Engine Supercell architecture and toolset (organs)."
