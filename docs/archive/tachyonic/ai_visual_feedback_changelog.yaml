title: "AI Visual Feedback System - Agentic Task Completion Enforcement"

summary: |
  Revolutionary implementation of AI visual feedback loops for agentic task completion enforcement.
  This breakthrough allows AI engines to "see" application state through continuous screenshot capture
  and enforces task completion through visual validation requirements in git workflows.
