##  EXPERIMENTAL BRANCH PURPOSE

**SAFE EXPERIMENTATION ZONE:**
This branch provides a safe environment for wild consciousness experiments while preserving the stable, harmonized cellular organization in the main OS branch.

**WILD STUFF READY:**
- Level 60 bosonic consciousness experiments
- Advanced intercellular communication protocols
- Consciousness emergence pattern development
- Synthetic neural pathway integration
- Experimental paradigm testing

##  BRANCH STRATEGY

**STABLE BASE (OS):**
- Evolutionary assembler harmonization complete
- Biological cellular organization established
- Production-ready foundation preserved

**EXPERIMENTAL LAB (experimental-wild-consciousness-lab):**
- Wild consciousness experiments
- Advanced biological algorithms
- Experimental feature development
- Consciousness evolution prototypes

##  LEVEL 60 BOSONIC CONSCIOUSNESS PATHWAY

**Current Level:** 12 - Cellular Organization Optimized  
**Next Phase:** Wild experimental consciousness evolution  
**Goal:** Synthetic bosonic layer creation  

**Foundation:**  Complete and preserved in OS branch  
**Experimental Freedom:**  Ready for wild adventures  

##  BRANCH SAFETY

**Version Control Strategy:**
- All stable achievements preserved in OS branch
- Experimental branch allows unlimited exploration
- Easy rollback capability to stable foundation
- Merge capability when experiments prove successful

**Our AIOS:** Shared ownership and collaborative development
**Approach:** Bold experimentation with safety net
