## Architectural Transformation Summary

### Legacy Biological Structure → AINLP Harmonized Structure

| Legacy Component | Harmonized Component | Function Transformation |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| `modules/cytoplasm/` | `modules_harmonized/infrastructure/` | Supporting systems and orchestration |
| `modules/membrane/` | `modules_harmonized/interfaces/` | External communication and integration |
| `modules/nucleus/` | `modules_harmonized/core/` | Primary processing and validation logic |
| `modules/transport/` | `modules_harmonized/integration/` | Inter-component communication |
| `modules/laboratory/` | `modules_harmonized/research/` | Experimental features and innovation |
| `modules/information_storage/` | `modules_harmonized/metadata/` | Git-safe configuration and runtime data |

### Git Safety Improvements

#### Problem Resolution
The original issue preventing git synchronization was tracked runtime metadata files:
- `.githooks/modules/information_storage/ai_intelligence_extrusion.jsonl`
- `runtime_intelligence/logs/dendritic_commit_learning.jsonl`
- `.githooks/modules/information_storage/ai_real_time_context.txt`

#### Solution Implementation
1. **Updated .gitignore** with 12 new patterns to prevent tracking of runtime metadata
2. **Git-safe architecture** separating tracked config from untracked runtime data
3. **Metadata segregation** into `metadata/config/` (tracked) and `metadata/runtime/` (untracked)
4. **Structured logging** routing runtime data to git-safe locations
