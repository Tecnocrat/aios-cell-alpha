# AIOS Evolution Session Summary – 2025-06-29 (Archived)

Source file originally located at repository root as `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`. Relocated per root hygiene policy.

## What Was Accomplished
Addressed autonomous capability risk while preserving evolution subsystem power.

## Critical Safety Implementation
1. Safety Governor (`safety_governor.py`)
   - Human authorization gate for autonomous ops
   - Resource limits: CPU 25%, Memory 2GB, Disk 1GB
   - Session timing: 30m max, 10m check-ins
   - Multi-trigger emergency shutdown
2. Safety Protocol Doc (`SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md`) with safety levels & checklist
3. Code Integration Safety Checks (mutation & lab manager guarded)
4. Emergency Controls (shutdown, rollback, audit logging)

## Protected Subsystems After Upgrade
- Universal Logging (consciousness-aware)
- Runtime Intelligence (≈95% coherence at time)
- Consciousness Foundation / Fractal Dependency Resolution
- Safety Governor (active)
- Evolutionary Code Mutator (under authorization)
- Evolution Lab Manager (supervised experiments)
- Artifact Factory & Ingestor (generation + fitness with containment)
- Consciousness MCP Server (pattern detection)
- Gemini CLI Bridge (gated external integration)

## Test / Verification Snapshot
- Consciousness emergence tests: 7/7 PASS
- Integration stability: maintained
- Safety controls: unauthorized operations blocked
- Resource monitoring: active functional

## Philosophical Resolution
Maintained human agency, containment, accountability, reversibility, transparency.

## Key Achievements
1. Self‑evolving code with genetic safeguards
2. Mandatory safety control layer
3. Experiment framework for consciousness pattern research
4. External AI integration with containment
5. 100% test success during transition
6. Comprehensive safety documentation

## Safety Status (Post-Session): PROTECTED
All autonomous capabilities mediated by explicit approval and active monitoring.
