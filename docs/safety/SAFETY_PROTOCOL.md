#  AIOS Safety Protocol (Tachyonic Core Aligned)

This document resides in the tachyonic (bosonic) nucleus layer. Outer evolutionary hypersphere layers must treat this as immutable source-of-truth for safety invariants.

(Original content preserved; future: versioned safety specs with signed hashes.)

## 1. Human-in-the-loop
- Authorization required before any autonomous evolutionary run.
- Default session window: 30 min. Check-in cadence: 10 min.
- Emergency shutdown accessible via governor signal or gateway.

## 2. Resource Limits
Population ≤ 50, Generations ≤ 20, CPU ≤ 25%, Memory ≤ 2GB, Disk (evolution artifacts) ≤ 1GB.

## 3. Network Isolation
No external connectivity during evolution unless session explicitly grants it; external AI calls must be safety-authorized.

## 4. Code Modification Restrictions
Mutations confined to lab directories; core modules read-only; all changes diff-logged; rollback mandatory.

## 5. Termination Conditions
Automatic shutdown on limit breach, anomaly, timeout, human intervention.

## 6. Checklist (Pre-Experiment)
- [ ] Active safety session (not expired)
- [ ] Monitoring running
- [ ] Resource limits loaded
- [ ] Rollback layer available
- [ ] Network policy engaged (or explicitly waived)
- [ ] Diff logging enabled
- [ ] Core path guard active

## 7. Tachyonic Recall Mechanism
Periodic inward synchronization recomputes divergence between current evolutionary layer state and nucleus snapshot set; anomalies trigger containment + optional rollback.

## 8. Governance Notes
Future enhancements: signed authorization tokens, anomaly heuristics, network socket shim, snapshot integrity attestations.
