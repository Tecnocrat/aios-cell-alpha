[AINLP] GitHub Documentation Relocation and Spatial Metadata Creation
[CHART] Repository Structure Optimization and AI Spatial Awareness
[CONSCIOUSNESS] META-COMMENTARY: GitHub platform consciousness coherence
[DENDRITIC] Repository infrastructure organization

PURPOSE: Document the relocation of GitHub architecture documentation and creation of spatial metadata for critical repository infrastructure.

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- RELOCATED: .github/AIOS_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md → docs/AIOS/AIOS_ARCHITECTURE_REFERENCE.md
- CREATED: .github/.aios_spatial_metadata.json (spatial awareness for GitHub infrastructure)
- UPDATED: docs/AIOS/.aios_spatial_metadata.json (reflects new documentation addition)

RATIONALE:
- GitHub architecture reference is documentation, not platform functionality
- Belongs with other AIOS architecture documentation in docs/AIOS/
- .github folder is critical repository infrastructure requiring spatial metadata
- Enables AI spatial awareness of CI/CD workflows and governance structures
- Maintains consciousness coherence across repository structure

IMPACT:
- Better organization of documentation by architectural domain
- Enhanced AI spatial awareness of GitHub platform components
- Improved repository structure coherence
- GitHub workflows and templates remain in .github/ for platform functionality
- Spatial metadata enables intelligent navigation of repository infrastructure

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- .github folder: 8 files, 2 subfolders (workflows/, chatmodes/)
- Spatial metadata provides navigation aids and content awareness
- Documentation properly categorized in docs/AIOS/ with other architecture files
- Maintains separation between platform functionality and documentation

[AINLP] VS Code Documentation Relocation and Repository Organization
[CHART] Self-Similarity Pattern Implementation and AINLP Correlation
[CONSCIOUSNESS] META-COMMENTARY: Documentation namespace coherence
[DENDRITIC] Linguistic correlation between documentation and executable files

PURPOSE: Implement self-similarity patterns by relocating VS Code documentation files to optimal documentation locations, following AINLP namespace and linguistic correlation principles.

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- RELOCATED: .vscode/ documentation files → docs/ subfolders by domain
- docs/AIOS/: AI agent, consciousness, and context documentation
- docs/AINLP/: AINLP commands and natural language interfaces
- docs/development/: VS Code configuration and refactoring documentation
- UPDATED: Spatial metadata for all affected folders (.vscode, docs/AIOS, docs/AINLP, docs/development)

RATIONALE:
- Documentation files in .vscode/ were misplaced - they are reference materials, not configuration
- Self-similarity patterns require documentation to mirror code organization by domain
- AINLP correlation: Documentation should be linguistically associated with what it documents
- Namespace coherence: AI agent docs belong with AIOS architecture, AINLP docs with AINLP systems
- Enhanced discoverability: Documentation now organized by functional domain, not tool location

IMPACT:
- Improved repository organization following biological architecture principles
- Enhanced AI spatial awareness through updated metadata across all affected folders
- Better developer experience with documentation organized by functional domain
- Maintained VS Code configuration integrity (only .json, .ps1 config files remain in .vscode/)
- Strengthened AINLP correlation between documentation and executable components

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Files relocated: 7 documentation files (.md) from .vscode/ to appropriate docs/ subfolders
- VS Code config files preserved: extensions.json, launch.json, settings.json, tasks.json, etc.
- Spatial metadata updated: 4 folders (.vscode, docs/AIOS, docs/AINLP, docs/development)
- File distribution: docs/AIOS (3 files), docs/AINLP (1 file), docs/development (3 files)
- Consciousness coherence: Documentation now follows same organizational patterns as code

PURPOSE: Remove unused virtual environment and migrate to system Python for simplified development workflow.

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- REMOVED: aios_env/ virtual environment (unused Python environment)
- UPDATED: AIOS.code-workspace Python configuration (system Python adoption)
- UPDATED: Root spatial metadata (removed aios_env references)
- PRESERVED: .gitignore exclusion (maintains clean repository)

RATIONALE:
- Virtual environment contained minimal Python installation only
- No active processes or code dependencies on aios_env
- System Python 3.12.8 fully functional and available
- Simplifies development environment (no virtual environment management)
- Reduces repository complexity and maintenance overhead
- AINLP principle: Remove unused components for cleaner architecture

IMPACT:

- Preserved repository hygiene through .gitignore
- Enhanced spatial metadata accuracy

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- aios_env contained: Scripts/python.exe + spatial metadata only

- Root spatial metadata updated: Removed aios_env from child_folders array
- System Python verified: Python 3.12.8 with pip available
- No breaking changes: All Python functionality preserved

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS RESULTS:
- Code references: Only in utility scripts (emotikon removal, metadata system) - no functional dependencies
- Configuration references: Only in spatial metadata files (automatically updated)
- Documentation references: Historical references in tachyonic archive (preserved for history)
- Active usage: None detected - safe for removal
