# AI Module Tools

Scope: AI-specific developer utilities, experiments, and scripts tightly coupled to the AI module.

Policy:
- Keep cross-cutting operational tools in `runtime_intelligence/tools`.
- Keep AI-local helpers here. Avoid duplicating central tools.

See central policy in `runtime_intelligence/tools/README.md`.
