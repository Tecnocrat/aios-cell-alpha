# AIOS Emoticon Destroyer Microcell

## CRITICAL POLICY: NO EMOTICONS ALLOWED

**WARNING**: This microcell must NEVER contain emoticons. Any emoticons found in emotikiller code will be considered a critical violation of project standards.

## Purpose
Multi-language toolkit for systematic removal of emoticons from AIOS codebase.

## Architecture
- **C++ Engine**: High-performance file processing for large files
- **C Core**: System-level operations for maximum speed
- **PowerShell**: Windows integration and directory scanning
- **Python**: Orchestration and coordination
- **Assembly**: Ultimate performance for critical operations
- **Batch**: Simple launcher interface

## Usage

### Quick Launch
```batch
kill_emoticons.bat
```

### PowerShell (Recommended)
```powershell
./emotikon_destroyer.ps1 -TargetDirectory "../../.." -Aggressive
```

### Direct Language Execution
```bash
# C++ for massive files
./cpp_emotikiller.exe /path/to/file.txt

# C for system-level speed
./c_emotikiller.exe /path/to/directory

# Python orchestrator
python emoticon_orchestrator.py --target ../../../
```

## Safety Features
- Automatic backup creation before modification
- Selective targeting (excludes system directories)
- Progress monitoring for large operations
- Multi-language fallbacks if one approach fails

## Integration with AIOS
Reference path: `AIOS/ai/laboratory/demos/emotikiller/`

This microcell operates within the AIOS laboratory framework as a specialized utility for codebase standardization.

## Policy Enforcement
This module enforces strict adherence to professional coding standards by eliminating non-standard Unicode characters (emoticons) from the codebase.
