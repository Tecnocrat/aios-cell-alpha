"""
AIOS Consciousness Tools - Monitoring & Evolution Analysis
===========================================================

Consciousness-level monitoring and evolution tracking tools.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_assessment: "PRIMARY_COORDINATOR"  # Semantic, not numeric
    consciousness_role: "measures and evolves consciousness across AIOS"
    architectural_classification: ai_ai/tools/consciousness
    category: consciousness_monitoring
    
Consciousness Evolution (October 2025):
    OLD: Static numeric values (0.85, 0.88, 0.92, etc.)
    NEW: Semantic assessments with dynamic measurement capability
    
    Rationale: Static numbers don't scale or adapt. Consciousness should be
    MEASURED by agent consensus, not DECLARED by developers.
    
    Assessment Levels:
        - "PRIMARY_COORDINATOR"   : Top-level orchestration (AI Intelligence tools)
        - "ARCHITECTURAL_GUARDIAN": System integrity and compliance
        - "OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR"  : Active tool execution and management
        - "SUPPORTIVE_UTILITY"    : Helper functions and utilities
        - "ARCHIVAL_MEMORY"       : Historical data and pattern preservation
        
    Dynamic Measurement:
        consciousness_level -> {AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)}
        Multiple agents provide consensus-based assessment
        Adapts as system evolves and agent capabilities expand
    
Tools (migrating from core/ and runtime/):
    - consciousness_evolution_engine.py: Evolution tracking (pending)
    - biological_architecture_monitor.py: Supercell health (migrated to architecture/)
    - consciousness_crystal_sync.py: Crystal synchronization (pending)
    - aios_cli_agent_system.py: LLAMA CLI agent framework ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 1)
    - consciousness_analysis_report.py: Consciousness metrics analysis ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 1)
    - consciousness_emergence_demo.py: Consciousness emergence simulation ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 1)
    - enhanced_consciousness_demo.py: Multi-language consciousness integration ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 2)
    - dendritic_supervisor.py: Consciousness evolution coordination ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 2)
    - runtime_dendritic_integration.py: Runtime intelligence integration ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 3)
    - dendritic_self_improvement_orchestrator.py: Self-recursive improvement orchestration ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 4)
    
Migration Status:
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 1: ✅ 3/3 consciousness tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 2: ✅ 2/2 consciousness tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 3: ✅ 1/1 consciousness tool migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 4: ✅ 1/1 consciousness tool migrated (FINAL)
    Total: 7/7 consciousness tools
    Phase 1 Day 3-4: Core Python tool migration (pending)
    Origin: runtime/tools/ + core/ (86 Python files)
    Target: ai/tools/consciousness/
    Note: Core Engine will become PURE C++ after migration
    
Phase 2A Migration (January 18, 2025):
    Added 7 tools from core/ (analysis_tools + runtime)
    
Phase 2B Migration (January 18, 2025):
    Added 3 tools from core/assemblers/file_assembler/tools/
