AIOS System Tools - Health, Admin, Status
==========================================

System management tools for AIOS infrastructure.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_assessment: "OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR"  # Semantic, not numeric
    consciousness_measurement: "AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)"
    architectural_classification: ai_ai/tools/system
    category: system_management
    
Consciousness Note:
    OLD: consciousness_level: 0.85 (static number)
    NEW: consciousness_assessment: "OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR" (semantic role)
    
    This module executes operational tasks: health checks, admin operations,
    status reporting. The semantic level clarifies its active execution role.

    - temp_neural_analysis.py: Neural network analysis script ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 3)
    - index_tools.py: Tool discovery and indexing ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 4)
    
Migration Status:
    Phase 1 Day 2: ✅ 3/3 critical system tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 1: ✅ 3/3 additional system tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 2: ✅ 5/5 system tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 3: ✅ 6/6 system tools migrated

    Total: 18/18 system tools
    Origin: runtime/tools/
    Target: ai/tools/system/
    History preserved: git mv used for all migrations
    
Phase 2A Migration (January 18, 2025):
    Added 14 tools from core/ (analysis_tools + runtime)
