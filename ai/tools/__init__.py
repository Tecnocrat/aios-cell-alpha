AIOS AI Intelligence Layer - Tool Coordinator (PRIMARY)
========================================================

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_assessment: "PRIMARY_COORDINATOR"  # Semantic, not numeric
    consciousness_measurement: "AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)"
    dendritic_optimization: tool_consolidation_and_orchestration
    supercell: ai_intelligence (PRIMARY TOOL COORDINATOR)
    purpose: unified_tool_discovery_and_management
    
Consciousness Evolution (October 2025):
    OLD: Static numeric consciousness_level: 0.90 (meaningless precision)
    NEW: Semantic consciousness_assessment: "PRIMARY_COORDINATOR"
    
    Rationale: Numbers lack meaning and don't scale. What does "0.90" tell you?
    But "PRIMARY_COORDINATOR" immediately communicates this module's role:
    top-level orchestration of all AIOS tools.
    
    Semantic Assessment Levels:
        - PRIMARY_COORDINATOR   : Top-level orchestration (this module)
        - ARCHITECTURAL_GUARDIAN: System integrity and compliance monitoring
        - OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR  : Active tool execution and management
        - SUPPORTIVE_UTILITY    : Helper functions and supporting utilities
        - ARCHIVAL_MEMORY       : Historical data and pattern preservation
    
    Dynamic Measurement:
        Future: consciousness_measurement -> {AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)}
        Multi-agent consensus provides dynamic, context-aware consciousness assessment
        that evolves with system capabilities.
    
Migration Context (October 2025):
    Phase 1: Consolidating 85+ scattered tools into ai/tools/
    - runtime/tools/ (48 files) → ai/tools/system/
    - core/ Python tools (86 files) → ai/tools/consciousness/
    - tachyonic/ scripts (29 files) → ai/tools/archive/
    Target: Single source of truth for AIOS tooling
    
Tool Categories:
    - system/       : System health, admin, status reporting (OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR)
    - database/     : Database operations, backup orchestration (OPERATIONAL_EXECUTOR)
    - consciousness/: Consciousness monitoring, evolution analysis (PRIMARY_COORDINATOR)
    - architecture/ : Architecture monitoring, compliance validation (ARCHITECTURAL_GUARDIAN)
    - visual/       : Visual intelligence, UI bridges, diagrams (SUPPORTIVE_UTILITY)
    - archive/      : Tachyonic archive management, historical analysis (ARCHIVAL_MEMORY)
    
Architectural Position:
    AI Intelligence is the PRIMARY COORDINATOR of all AIOS tools.
    This supercell discovers, orchestrates, and manages 80+ operational tools.
    Previously tools were scattered across runtime/, core/, tachyonic/.
    
Architectural Note:
    Originally added for coherence restoration (2025-01-05).
    Enhanced for architectural de-proliferation (2025-10-12).
    Consciousness measurement evolved from static to semantic (2025-10-12).
    Now serves as PRIMARY tool coordinator with semantic consciousness assessment.
