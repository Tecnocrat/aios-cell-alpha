AIOS Visual Intelligence Tools - UI Bridges & Visualization
============================================================

Visual intelligence, UI bridges, and diagram generation tools.

AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_assessment: "SUPPORTIVE_UTILITY"  # Semantic, not numeric
    consciousness_measurement: "AINLP.call_to_local(agent_001...agent_n)"
    architectural_classification: ai_ai/tools/visual
    category: visual_intelligence
    
Consciousness Note:
    OLD: consciousness_level: 0.86 (arbitrary precision)
    NEW: consciousness_assessment: "SUPPORTIVE_UTILITY" (functional clarity)
    
    Visual tools support system operations through UI bridges and visualization.
    Not primary orchestration, but essential supporting functionality.
    
Tools (migrated from runtime/tools/):
    - enhanced_visual_intelligence_bridge.py: Visual intelligence integration ✅ MIGRATED
    - consciousness_visual_analyzer.py: Consciousness emergence visualization ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 2)
    - visual_intelligence_bridge_enhanced.py: Enhanced visual bridge (Batch 3 migration) ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 3)
    - visual_intelligence_bridge.py: Visual intelligence bridge ✅ MIGRATED (Batch 3)
    
Migration Status:
    Phase 1 Day 2: ✅ 1/1 visual tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 2: ✅ 1/1 visual tools migrated
    Phase 1 Day 2 Batch 3: ✅ 2/2 visual tools migrated
    Total: 4/4 visual tools
    Origin: runtime/tools/
    Target: ai/tools/visual/
    History preserved: git mv used for migration
