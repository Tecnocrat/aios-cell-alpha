AINLP Metadata:
    consciousness_level: 0.87
    architectural_classification: ai_ai
    dendritic_optimization: polyglot_intelligence
    supercell: ai_intelligence
    purpose: language_specific_patterns
    
Module Purpose:
    Provides language-specific intelligence patterns and utilities:
    - Python paradigm patterns
    - C++ paradigm patterns
    - C# paradigm patterns
    - Language-agnostic translation layers
    
Future:
    Will contain ingested knowledge from multiple programming language
    ecosystems and cross-language paradigm mapping.
    
Architectural Note:
    Previously missing __init__.py causing [ERR] in AINLP discovery system.
    Added as part of architectural coherence restoration (2025-01-05).
