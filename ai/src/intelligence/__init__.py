"""
🧬 AIOS Core Module

Core intelligence components for AIOS including library ingestion,
consciousness integration, and learning protocols.

BIOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE:
🧬 NUCLEUS: Core processing and intelligence coordination
🧠 CONSCIOUSNESS: Integration with AIOS consciousness framework
📚 LIBRARY_LEARNING: Multi-language code learning system
🔗 INTEGRATION: Cross-component communication
