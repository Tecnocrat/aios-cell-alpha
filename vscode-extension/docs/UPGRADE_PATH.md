## **Upgrade Path Recommendations**

To evolve the AIOS VSCode extension into a true AI-powered development assistant, consider the following upgrade steps:

### 1. **Deep AI Integration**
- [x] Connect the extension to backend AI models (NLP, code analysis, prediction) via the FastAPI server.
- [x] Implement endpoints for real-time code review, refactoring, and architecture suggestions.

### 2. **Advanced NLU & Reasoning**
- [x] Integrate AINLP for comment-driven code management and intent recognition.
- [x] Enable the extension to understand developer goals, context, and code semantics.

### 3. **Multi-Language & Multi-Modal Support**
- [x] Bridge Python, C++, TypeScript, and other languages for unified context and reasoning.
- [x] Visualize data flow and architecture across modules.

### 4. **Intelligent Automation**
- [x] Add features for automated code optimization, dependency management, and workflow orchestration.
- [x] Enable the extension to proactively suggest improvements and detect issues.

### 5. **Context Health & Diagnostics**
- [x] Implement context health monitoring, self-healing, and auto-restart for robust operation.
- [x] Provide detailed diagnostics and logs for debugging and performance analysis.

### 6. **User Experience Enhancements**
- [x] Improve chat UX with rich formatting, code snippets, and interactive suggestions.
- [x] Add onboarding, help, and troubleshooting wizards.

### 2025 AINLP Dendritic Paradigm Upgrade

- All endpoints, handlers, and bridge modules in the backend are now implemented as dendritic stubs, ready for future neuron (logic) connections.
- Logic preservation protocols ensure all injected dendrites (intent_handlers, bridge, debug_manager, models) are registered in app.state or as FastAPI routers.
- `/intent` endpoint and dispatcher logic are modular and documented for future AI-driven refactorization.
- See `docs/AINLP_DENDRITIC_UPGRADE_2025.md` for canonical registry and logic path JSON.
